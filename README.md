# Tauri Typescript React Boilerplate

A Tauri Typescript React Boilerplate that works out of the box.

- [x] MacOS
- [x] Windows 10
- [ ] Linux (Probably works but I haven't tested)
- [ ] WSL (almost...)

## Setup

Follow the [Tauri setup docs](https://tauri.studio/docs/getting-started/intro/) in your platform to get everything set up for Tauri development, then run

```bash
$ npm install
```

## Development

```bash
$ npm run dev
```

There's an example app that shows a little bit of how you can communicate between the front end (Typescript/JS) and back end (Rust)

## Build

```bash
$ npm run build
```

Tauri will walk you through the rest.

## What doesn't work

- Typescript autocomplete with Tauri imports. This has to do with the `tauri` npm package. It's probably coming soon...
- Linting and code formatting for Typescript. I might add this later.
